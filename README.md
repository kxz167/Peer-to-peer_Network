# Java Peer to Peer Network
## Background:
In order to explore peer to peer networks, we utilized Java to create a floodable network. Each host would hold files, a list of their available files, and a folder for received files. 

For communication, we utilized TCP connections through a list of all available hosts. 
## Operating Environment:
The operating environment meant for this program is a Java 7 server on the Case network. As such, each host name can be resolved through Case' DNS servers.
## Running:
In order to run the program, all files must be compiled and we can run the `p2p.java` file.
